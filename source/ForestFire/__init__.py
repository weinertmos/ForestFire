"""ForestFire is a Python tool that aims to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms. 
It utilises the Random Forest algorithm - which is itself a machine learning technique - to determine the 
importance of feature sets in a given set of data.
It is most usefull in data sets with a number of feature sets >10.

In order to use ForestFire you are required to provide your Test data in the form of two numpy arrays:

* X - containing the values of the feature sets for each data set
* y - containing the corresponding performance of those feature sets as a single value
